Changes from Build.xml 
date 4/18/17
=====================================

Changed code :
-----------
IglooScore1 :
-----------
line 39:  should be score1 greater than score2(score1>score2) because it is taking the larger number instead of the smaller one 
eventually subtract.

IglooScore2 :
-----------
line 44: s2 changed to score3 because score2 was less than score3 and we were finding the largest number inputed.
line 49+50: are for if all numbers are equal instead of putting in a value we should just have the two scores of any combination 
placed in instead.

notes:
--------------

 Line 59 in IglooScore2 cannot be reachd because the if statment will never have all 4 branches occur.
line 59: if (args==null || args.length != 3) 
to correct it can set it to args.length == 0 or just take out or because it should always have 3 nothing more or less.
